    <h1> Tristen Howard:Website Developer</h1>
  </header><!-- Title of site-->
  <h2> I can build a website that functions and looks better than any website builder.</h2>
  <p> I am well-versed in HTML and CSS, and I have some knowledge in Javascript and Python as well.


  <h2> My Projects</h2>
  <div>
    <div id="Jim">
      <!-- JimsLandscaping the first showcase of my webdev skills-->
      <img src="Images/jimsLandscaping.png" alt="Jim">
      <p> This is the first site I uploaded to a live server. I created a fake company and designed a website for it, including a home page,about page, and a form page where you can make an appointment.
        I went with the Earthy colors to drive the landscaping part of the company home.</p>

    <div id="blog">
      <img src="Images/blogSite.png" alt="blog"><!-- Super Cool Blogsite where I tried to flex my creativity-->
      <p> This is another site I uploaded to a live server. I did more experimenting with this site and the way it looks to try out new things, and as weird as it looks, I really like the way it turned out.
        I included several blog posts about restaurants and touring in Springfield to try and mimic someone who writes a weekly blog about their city. I also included a profile for one of the bloggers and a user profile to make it look more
        realistic.</p>

    <div id="travel"> <!-- A responsive Branson travel site I made to practice media queries-->
        <img src="Images/responsiveTravel.png" alt="Travel">
        <p> This is a responsive travel site I made about visiting Branson.
            The site gets more compact as the device width gets lower, making it less clunky and crammed on mobile devices.</p>

    <div id="game">
