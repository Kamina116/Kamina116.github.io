<h2> About Tristen Howard</h2>
<p> I am 19 years old in my 2nd year of college at OTC.
    I came here to do my gen eds and figure out my career path while I did that.
    My original plan was just to get a transfer degree and hopefully have something figured out by the time I transferred to a 4 year school.
    I always thought computers were cool and I love to play video games so I figured I'd give CIS a shot since there was no particular program that interested me.
    This semester was really make it or break it in terms of me staying in this program since the last semester I was just learning the basics of Microsoft programs.
    I didn't think I was gonna go through with this program until a month and a half through the semester when I uploaded the Jims Landscaping project to a live server.
    Now looking at that page and knowing anyone can see it, see what I've done and see a cool website that some kid who is just getting his feet wet made, makes me happy.
    It feels like I've actually done something that I can look back at anytime I want, instead of having these temporary files on my computer that could get deleted at any time.
    Of course as I said before one of my hobbies is playing video games, but I do have a few others.
    For instance, I do binge watch Netflix shows and anime, I also play my viola every now and then, and I think I might add Website Design to that list too although I don't see myself doing it as often as the others.
    Unfortunately since this is my first major CIS semester where I'm just starting to learn all this I don't have any related work experience or outside school projects but hopefully soon I'll be able to change that.
